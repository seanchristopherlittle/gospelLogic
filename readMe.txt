"Experience is not the best teacher, Evaluated Experience is the best teacher..."

My app will be a monthly check-in where the client will be able to evaluate themselves according to ten different categories and be able to track progress and reflect on their experience.  My faith plays a huge role in my life and the ten categories are taken from a New Year's message given by one of my favorite pastor's Chris Hodges.  

Client will login to their personal account. 

Dashboard will show entries by month and a picture uploaded by the client.
-I think it would be cool to be able to display avg scores for the different categories so far for that year.
-Client will be able to click into monthly entries in order to review details, notes and pictures from the entry.
-api to search Bible verses according to the various categories for inspiration.

I plan to use MERN stack in order to build app.  

I am still working on wire frame, unfamiliar w/ balsamiq and may try Miro but have a good visualization of what I would like the app to look like.
